Reading map (extended format) from [ sim1.bim ] 
10 markers to be included from [ sim1.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ sim1.fam ] 
2000 individuals read from [ sim1.fam ] 
2000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
1000 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 2000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ sim1.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
2000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
After filtering, 1000 cases, 1000 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 2000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing xepistasis pairwise results to [ try1.xepi.cc ] 
threshold for displaying xepistatic result (--xepi1) : p <= 1
threshold for counting epistatic result (--xepi2) : p <= 1
ALL x ALL xepistasis mode
Performed a total of 45 valid SNP x SNP tests
